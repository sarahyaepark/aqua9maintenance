# Aqua9+ Maintenance

## Local Setup

Fork & clone this repo and then

* Run the following commands:
* `npm install`
* Create two postgres databases

```
createdb $Unwind
createdb $Unwind-test
```

* `npm run seed` for some seed data

## Start

Running `npm run start-dev` will make great things happen!

If you want to run the server and/or `webpack` separately, you can also
`npm run start-server` and `npm run build-client`.

From there, just follow your bliss.
